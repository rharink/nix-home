# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# Body
#
# Footer

# <type> must be one of the following:
#
# - feat: A new feature
# - fix: A bug fix
# - docs: Documentation only changes
# - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
# - perf: A code change that improves performance
# - test: Adding missing tests
# - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
#
# The <scope> could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For
# ellipticlicense, datasource, etc...
#
# The <subject> contains succinct description of the change:
#
# - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes" don't
# - capitalize first letter no dot (.) at the end
#
# Body, just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not
# "changed" nor "changes" The body should include the motivation for the change
# and contrast this with previous behavior.
#
# The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the
# place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.
#
# Breaking Changes are detected as such if the footer contains a line starting
# with BREAKING CHANGE: (with optional newlines) The rest of the commit message is
# then used for this.
