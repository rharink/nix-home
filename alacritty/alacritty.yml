# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization.
  #
  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
  #
  # Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
  # You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions in character columns and lines
  # (changes require restart)
  dimensions:
    columns: 0
    lines: 0

  # Window position (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of pixels.
  # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
  #position:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Adds this many blank pixels of padding around the window
  # Units are physical pixels; this is not DPI aware.
  # (change requires restart)
  padding:
    x: 5
    y: 5

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
  history: 10000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  normal:
    family: IBM Plex Mono
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Text

  # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: IBM Plex Mono
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Bold

  # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: IBM Plex Mono
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    style: Italic

  # Point size of the font
  size: 14.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increase the x offset to move the glyph to
  # the right, increase the y offset to move the glyph upward.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # OS X only: use thin stroke font rendering. Thin strokes are suitable
  # for retina displays, but for non-retina you probably want this set to
  # false.
  use_thin_strokes: true

# When true, bold text is drawn using the bright variant of colors.
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: true

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:
#   - Ease
#   - EaseOut
#   - EaseOutSine
#   - EaseOutQuad
#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart
#   - EaseOutQuint
#   - EaseOutExpo
#   - EaseOutCirc
#   - Linear
#
# Specifying a `duration` of `0` will disable the visual bell.
visual_bell:
  animation: EaseOutExpo
  duration: 0
  color: '0xffffff'

# Background opacity
#
# Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
# The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.
background_opacity: 1.0

selection:
  semantic_escape_chars: ",│`|:\"' ()[]{}<>\t"

  # When set to `true`, selected text will be copied to the primary clipboard.
  save_to_clipboard: true

# Allow terminal applications to change Alacritty's window title.
dynamic_title: true

cursor:
  # Cursor style
  #
  # Values for `style`:
  #   - ▇ Block
  #   - _ Underline
  #   - | Beam
  style: Block

  # If this is `true`, the cursor will be rendered as a hollow box when the
  # window is not focused.
  unfocused_hollow: true

# Live config reload (changes require restart)
live_config_reload: true

debug:
  # Display the time it takes to redraw each frame.
  render_timer: false

  # Keep the log file after quitting Alacritty.
  persistent_logging: false

  # Log level
  #
  # Values for `log_level`:
  #   - None
  #   - Error
  #   - Warn
  #   - Info
  #   - Debug
  #   - Trace
  log_level: Warn

  # Print all received window events.
  print_events: false

  # Record all characters and escape sequences as test data.
  ref_test: false


# Mouse bindings
#
# Available fields:
#   - mouse
#   - action
#   - mods (optional)
#
# Values for `mouse`:
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# All available `mods` and `action` values are documented in the key binding
# section.
mouse_bindings:
  - { mouse: Middle, action: PasteSelection }

mouse:
  # Click settings
  #
  # The `double_click` and `triple_click` settings control the time
  # alacritty should wait for accepting multiple clicks as one double
  # or triple click.
  double_click: { threshold: 300 }
  triple_click: { threshold: 300 }

   # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.
  hide_when_typing: false

  url:
    # URL launcher
    #
    # This program is executed when clicking on a text which is recognized as a URL.
    # The URL is always added to the command as the last parameter.
    #
    # When set to `None`, URL launching will be disabled completely.
    #
    # Default:
    #   - (macOS) open
    #   - (Linux) xdg-open
    #   - (Windows) explorer
    launcher:
      program: open
      args: []

    # URL modifiers
    #
    # These are the modifiers that need to be held down for opening URLs when clicking
    # on them. The available modifiers are documented in the key binding section.
    modifiers: None


# Shell
#
# You can set shell.program to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. /bin/fish.
# Entries in shell.args are passed unmodified as arguments to the shell.
#
# shell:
#   program: /bin/bash
#   args:
#     - --login

# Key bindings
#
# Each binding is defined as an object with some properties. Most of the
# properties are optional. All of the alphabetical keys should have a letter for
# the `key` value such as `V`. Function keys are probably what you would expect
# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as
# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,
# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.
#
# A list with all available `key` names can be found here:
# https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
# Possible values for `mods`
# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key
# `Control` for the control key
# `Shift` for the Shift key
# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option
#
# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift
# looks like:
#
# mods: Control|Shift
#
# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -
# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace
# around them.
#
# Either an `action`, `chars`, or `command` field must be present.
#   `action` must be one of `Paste`, `PasteSelection`, `Copy`, or `Quit`.
#   `chars` writes the specified string every time that binding is activated.
#     These should generally be escape sequences, but they can be configured to
#     send arbitrary strings of bytes.
#   `command` must be a map containing a `program` string, and `args` array of
#     strings. For example:
#     - { ... , command: { program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] } }
